# Unified Session Architecture – Status & Remaining Tasks

## Executive Summary

The unified session architecture is **nearly complete**. All core infrastructure is implemented and in use. Only minor updates to client components, tests, and documentation remain.

## Architecture Status


### ✅ **COMPLETE**

1. **Database Schema** – Unified sessions table, session_events, workspace_layout (`src/lib/server/db/DatabaseManager.js`)
2. **RunSessionManager** – Event-sourced session management (`src/lib/server/runtime/RunSessionManager.js`)
3. **Adapters** – PtyAdapter and ClaudeAdapter with comprehensive options support
4. **Socket.IO Setup** – Unified run:* events (`src/lib/server/socket-setup.js`)
5. **Services Initialization** – Proper DI with adapters (`src/lib/server/services/index.js`)
6. **API Routes** – Using unified session API (`src/routes/api/sessions/+server.js`)
7. **RunSessionClient** – Client-side unified session management


### � **IN PROGRESS / REMAINING**

1. **Client Components** – Some still reference legacy socket events; need to finish migration to RunSessionClient
2. **Test Suite** – Some tests still use old socket events and patterns; need to update to unified run:* events
3. **Documentation** – Needs update to reflect unified architecture and remove legacy references
4. **Dead Code Cleanup** – Remove any remaining legacy event constants and unused files

## Remaining Tasks


### 1. Update Client Components

- Finish migrating all Svelte client components to use RunSessionClient exclusively
- Remove direct socket.io usage from components
- Ensure all event handling uses unified run:event pattern


### 2. Update and Modernize Test Suite

- Update all tests to use unified run:* events and RunSessionManager
- Remove references to deprecated socket events
- Ensure E2E and unit tests verify unified session flows


### 3. Documentation and Cleanup

- Update documentation to reflect unified session patterns
- Remove or update any legacy code, constants, or files


## Success Criteria

- All client components use RunSessionClient
- All tests pass with unified architecture
- No legacy socket events in use
- Documentation is up-to-date and accurate
- No dead code or legacy event constants remain


## Risk Assessment

**LOW RISK**: Core infrastructure is solid. Remaining work is minor and focused on cleanup and modernization.


## Conclusion

The unified session architecture is functionally complete. The last steps are to finish client and test migration, update documentation, and remove any remaining legacy code. This will result in a clean, maintainable, and modern codebase with a single consistent pattern for session management across all session types.
