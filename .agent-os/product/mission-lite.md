# Product Mission (Lite)

Dispatch is a containerized web-based terminal and AI development environment that provides secure sandboxed execution for Claude AI and CLI agents, enabling AI-assisted development in isolated Docker containers with resumable sessions, real-time collaboration, and cross-device continuity.

Dispatch serves individual developers and development teams who need AI-powered development environments with secure isolation and persistent sessions. Unlike traditional terminal multiplexers or separate AI tools, Dispatch provides a unified session management system with event-sourced architecture, native Claude AI integration, and cross-device session continuity that eliminates context switching overhead and enables true mobile-to-desktop development workflows.
