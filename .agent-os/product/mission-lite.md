# Dispatch Mission (Lite)

Dispatch provides containerized web-based terminal access with sandboxed environments specifically designed for autonomous AI agents and secure remote development.

**Value & Differentiator:** Unlike traditional terminal sharing solutions, Dispatch offers container-native isolation, AI agent integration (Claude Code), real-time web interface, and instant public sharing - all while maintaining security through non-root execution and proper session management.
