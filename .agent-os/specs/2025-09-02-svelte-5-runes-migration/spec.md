> Spec: Svelte 5 Runes Migration
> Created: 2025-09-02
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Migrate the entire Dispatch codebase from legacy Svelte 4 syntax to the new Svelte 5 runes syntax, ensuring all components, pages, and viewmodels are updated without introducing breaking changes. This migration will modernize the codebase, improve performance, and align with the latest Svelte best practices.

## User Stories

### Maintaining Development Experience
As a developer, I want to work with modern Svelte 5 runes syntax, so that I can leverage the latest framework features and maintain consistency across the codebase.

The migration should update all reactive declarations ($:), stores ($store), lifecycle hooks (onMount, onDestroy), and event handling to use the new runes API ($state, $derived, $effect, etc.) while preserving all existing functionality.

### Preserving User Functionality  
As an end user, I want all terminal features to continue working seamlessly after the migration, so that my workflow remains uninterrupted.

All terminal sessions, socket communications, UI interactions, and project management features must function identically before and after the migration, with no visible changes to the user interface or behavior.

## Spec Scope

1. **Component Migration** - Update all Svelte components to use runes syntax for state management and reactivity
2. **Page Migration** - Convert all route pages and layouts to Svelte 5 patterns
3. **Store Refactoring** - Replace Svelte stores with runes-based state management where applicable
4. **Event Handler Updates** - Modernize event handling to use new Svelte 5 patterns
5. **Lifecycle Management** - Convert lifecycle hooks to $effect runes

## Out of Scope

- Adding new features or functionality
- Changing the UI design or layout
- Modifying backend services or Socket.IO implementation
- Upgrading other dependencies beyond Svelte
- Performance optimizations beyond what runes naturally provide

## Expected Deliverable

1. All Svelte files using consistent Svelte 5 runes syntax with no legacy patterns remaining
2. Fully functional application with all existing features working as before
3. No console errors or warnings related to deprecated Svelte syntax
