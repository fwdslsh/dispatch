# Svelte 5 Runes Migration - Lite Summary

Migrate the entire Dispatch codebase from legacy Svelte 4 syntax to Svelte 5 runes syntax, updating all components, pages, and viewmodels to use $state, $derived, $effect and other runes while preserving all existing functionality. This modernization ensures consistency with latest Svelte best practices without introducing any breaking changes to the terminal, UI, or Socket.IO features.
