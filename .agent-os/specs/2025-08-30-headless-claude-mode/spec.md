> Spec: Headless Claude Mode Integration
> Created: 2025-08-30
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement headless Claude CLI integration with JSON output control and programmatic API access, allowing automated workflows to interact with Claude sessions without requiring browser-based terminal interfaces.

## User Stories

1. **As a developer integrating with Dispatch**, I want to create and interact with Claude sessions programmatically via API endpoints, so that I can build automated workflows that leverage Claude's capabilities without manual terminal interaction.

2. **As an automation system**, I want to send commands to Claude sessions and receive structured JSON responses, so that I can process Claude's output programmatically and integrate it into larger automated pipelines.

3. **As a session manager**, I want to control Claude sessions by session ID through REST API calls, so that I can manage multiple concurrent Claude interactions and route responses to the appropriate consuming systems.

## Spec Scope

1. **Headless Claude CLI Integration**: Extend existing PTY session management to support Claude CLI in headless mode with JSON output formatting and structured response handling.

2. **RESTful API Endpoints**: Implement REST API endpoints for session creation, command execution, output retrieval, and session management that complement the existing Socket.IO interface.

3. **Session ID-based Control**: Enhance session management to support programmatic interaction via session identifiers, allowing external systems to target specific Claude instances.

4. **Structured Output Management**: Implement JSON output formatting and parsing for Claude responses, enabling programmatic consumption of Claude's analysis and recommendations.

5. **Input/Output Buffer Management**: Create buffered input/output handling for headless sessions, supporting both real-time streaming and batch processing modes for different automation use cases.

## Out of Scope

- Browser-based UI changes or enhancements to the existing terminal interface
- Authentication mechanisms beyond existing TERMINAL_KEY system
- Real-time collaborative editing or multi-user session sharing
- Integration with external AI services other than Claude CLI
- Advanced session persistence or database storage beyond current JSON-based approach

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Headless API**: REST endpoints that can create Claude sessions, execute commands programmatically, and return structured JSON responses with proper error handling and session state management.

2. **Enhanced Session Management**: Extended TerminalManager class supporting both interactive and headless Claude modes with session ID-based routing and proper lifecycle management.

3. **Integration Testing Suite**: Automated tests demonstrating successful headless Claude session creation, command execution, output parsing, and session cleanup for various automation scenarios.
