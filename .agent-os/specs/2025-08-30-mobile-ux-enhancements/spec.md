# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Mobile UX Enhancements
> Created: 2025-08-30

## Overview

Enhance the mobile user experience for Dispatch by optimizing virtual keyboard interactions, maximizing terminal screen space, and implementing intelligent output deduplication. This feature will improve usability on phones and tablets while reducing unnecessary rendering overhead from progress indicators and repetitive output.

## User Stories

### Mobile Developer Terminal Access

As a mobile developer, I want to access my development sessions from my phone or tablet, so that I can monitor builds and debug issues while away from my desk.

The user opens Dispatch on their mobile device and sees a touch-optimized interface with the terminal taking up maximum screen space. The virtual keyboard includes a custom toolbar with frequently used terminal commands and shortcuts. When running commands with progress indicators or streaming output, the terminal intelligently replaces repetitive content instead of creating endless scrolling, making it easier to track actual progress on a small screen.

### Remote System Administrator

As a system administrator, I want to manage servers from my mobile device during emergencies, so that I can respond to critical issues immediately regardless of my location.

The administrator accesses a server session through their phone, with UI panels collapsing automatically to maximize terminal visibility. A mobile-optimized command palette provides quick access to common administrative commands. The intelligent output handling ensures that log tailing and monitoring tools don't overwhelm the mobile interface with redundant data.

## Spec Scope

1. **Virtual Keyboard Optimization** - Custom toolbar with common terminal commands, special keys, and configurable shortcuts
2. **Collapsible UI Panels** - Auto-hiding headers, sidebars, and toolbars to maximize terminal space on mobile screens
3. **Mobile Command Palette** - Touch-friendly command selector with search, recent commands, and customizable favorites
4. **Intelligent Output Deduplication** - Detection and replacement of repetitive output patterns like progress indicators and status updates
5. **Responsive Layout System** - Adaptive layouts for phones (< 768px) and tablets (768px - 1024px) in both portrait and landscape

## Out of Scope

- Native mobile app development (iOS/Android)
- Offline session persistence
- Mobile-specific authentication methods (biometric, etc.)
- File upload/download functionality optimization
- Multi-touch gestures beyond basic scrolling

## Expected Deliverable

1. Virtual keyboard with custom toolbar visible and functional on mobile devices
2. UI panels that automatically collapse/expand based on screen size and user interaction
3. Command palette accessible via touch that provides quick command insertion
4. Terminal output that intelligently replaces repetitive content instead of appending
5. Responsive design that works on phones (iOS Safari 15+, Chrome 100+) and tablets
