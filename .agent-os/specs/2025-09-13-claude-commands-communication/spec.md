> Spec: Claude Commands Communication
> Created: 2025-09-13
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix Claude Code commands communication between client and server to ensure available commands are properly loaded and displayed in the user interface. This will improve user experience by providing clear visibility into available Claude Code functionality and enabling proper command discovery.

## User Stories

### Claude Code User Command Discovery

As a developer using Claude Code sessions, I want to see available commands in the interface, so that I can understand what functionality is available and use Claude effectively.

When a user starts a Claude Code session, they should be able to access a list of supported commands (like /clear, /compact, etc.) through the UI. The system has command discovery implemented but Socket.IO event routing issues prevent commands from reaching the client consistently.

### Session-Specific Command Loading

As a user with multiple Claude sessions, I want commands to be loaded per session, so that each session shows its current available functionality.

The client should receive and display commands specific to each Claude session, updating the UI when new sessions are created or when command availability changes.

## Spec Scope

1. **Session ID Routing Fix** - Fix Socket.IO event routing between server and client for consistent session identification
2. **Socket.IO Handler Enhancement** - Add Claude command lookup to existing session.status handler
3. **Reconnection Support** - Ensure commands are available when clients reconnect to existing Claude sessions
4. **Client ID Normalization** - Handle multiple session ID formats on client side

## Out of Scope

- Creating new Claude Code commands (only fixing display of existing ones)
- Modifying command execution logic (focus is on communication fix)
- Command history or autocomplete features
- Major architectural changes to command discovery system

## Expected Deliverable

1. Client receives and displays available Claude Code commands for each session
2. Commands are loaded automatically when Claude sessions are created/resumed
3. UI provides clear visibility into available Claude Code functionality
