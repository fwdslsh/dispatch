## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Tasks 1-6): Core Authentication Foundation
- **Database Schema & Models**: Complete auth tables with proper relationships and migrations
- **Authentication Manager**: Pluggable adapter pattern with JWT session management
- **WebAuthn/Passkeys**: Full server-side implementation with credential management
- **OAuth Integration**: Google and GitHub providers with dynamic redirect URI handling
- **Security Policies**: Dynamic CORS, cookies, HSTS, CSRF, and certificate management
- **Admin Interface**: Complete user, device, session, and security management interface

### üöß IN PROGRESS (Task 7): Tunnel Integration
- **TunnelManager**: Base implementation exists, needs auth integration hooks
- **Security Policy Updates**: Need automatic updates on URL changes
- **Provider Integration**: OAuth redirect URI auto-updates needed

### ‚è≥ PENDING (Tasks 8-9): UI Components & Testing
- **Authentication UI**: Login modals, WebAuthn flows, OAuth selection interfaces
- **User Experience**: Device management, session UI, onboarding flows
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflows, security audits, performance testing

### Test Status
- **Passing**: 264/323 tests (82% pass rate)
- **Known Issues**: Some admin interface tests have database constraint conflicts
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive unit tests for all auth components

This represents a significant milestone with the complete authentication foundation implemented and ready for UI integration and final testing phases.
