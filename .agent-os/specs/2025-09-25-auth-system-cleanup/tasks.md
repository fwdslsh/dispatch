## Implementation Notes

### Technical Dependencies

- **Database tasks (Task 3)** should be completed before **server-side cleanup (Task 1)** to avoid referential integrity issues
- **Server-side cleanup (Task 1)** must be completed before **client-side cleanup (Task 2)** to maintain API consistency
- **Testing updates (Task 4)** should run in parallel with implementation tasks to maintain TDD approach
- **Documentation updates (Task 5)** should be completed before **cleanup test removal (Task 6)**
- **Cleanup test removal (Task 6)** must be completed last after all other tasks are verified

### Cleanup Test Strategy

- All cleanup verification tests are isolated in `tests/cleanup/` subdirectories
- These tests are temporary and will be removed in Task 6 after successful implementation
- Cleanup tests validate removal completeness but are not part of the permanent test suite
- Core authentication tests remain in their original locations and are preserved

### Risk Mitigation

- Create database backup before any schema changes
- Maintain rollback procedures for each major task
- Use feature flags if gradual rollout is needed
- Test authentication flows thoroughly at each step

### Architecture Compatibility

- Maintain SvelteKit 2.x with Svelte 5 patterns throughout cleanup
- Preserve Socket.IO unified protocol structure
- Keep event-sourced session management architecture intact
- Maintain MVVM pattern and ServiceContainer dependency injection

### Success Criteria

- All migration-related code completely removed from codebase
- Authentication system functions identically to pre-cleanup state
- Test coverage maintained or improved for core authentication functionality
- No deprecated authentication vectors remain in production system
- Documentation reflects simplified authentication architecture only
