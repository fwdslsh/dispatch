# Spec Summary (Lite)

Enable users to assign custom names to terminal sessions for easy identification and organization, replacing anonymous session IDs with meaningful names. Users can provide descriptive names during session creation and rename existing sessions through the UI, while the system creates readable directory paths in the file system corresponding to session names.
