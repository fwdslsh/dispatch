# UI Architecture Refactor - Lite Summary

Refactor Dispatch's unmaintainable UI architecture by decomposing god components (1,215-line project page), implementing MVVM patterns with proper separation of concerns, and standardizing state management using Svelte 5 runes. This architectural cleanup will establish scalable, testable components under 300 lines each while removing dead code and over-engineered features that compromise maintainability.

## Key Points
- Break down 1,215-line project page into 5-8 focused components under 200 lines each
- Implement MVVM pattern with clear Model-View-ViewModel separation throughout the application
- Standardize all state management using Svelte 5 runes and contexts, eliminating inconsistent patterns
