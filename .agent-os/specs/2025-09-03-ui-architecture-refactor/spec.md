# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: UI Architecture Refactor
> Created: 2025-09-03
> Status: Planning

## Overview

The current UI architecture in Dispatch has evolved into an unmaintainable state with critical architectural violations that compromise code quality, testability, and maintainability. This spec addresses systematic refactoring to implement proper MVVM patterns, component decomposition, and state management consolidation.

Key architectural problems identified:

- God components violating Single Responsibility Principle (1,215-line project page)
- Missing MVVM separation leading to untestable business logic
- Over-engineered components with YAGNI violations
- Unintegrated components representing wasted development effort
- Inconsistent state management patterns across the application

This refactor will establish a scalable, maintainable architecture following modern UI patterns while leveraging our greenfield beta status to make necessary breaking changes.

## User Stories

As a **developer maintaining the Dispatch codebase**, I want:

- Component files under 300 lines so I can easily understand and modify individual components
- Clear separation between view logic and business logic so I can test business rules independently
- Consistent state management patterns so I can predict how data flows through the application
- Reusable components that follow DRY principles so I can build features efficiently
- Clean component interfaces so I can work on features without understanding the entire codebase

As a **new developer joining the project**, I want:

- Self-contained components with clear responsibilities so I can understand the codebase quickly
- Consistent architectural patterns so I can contribute effectively without extensive onboarding
- Well-defined component contracts so I can work on features without breaking existing functionality

As a **user of the Dispatch application**, I want:

- Consistent UI behavior across all screens so I can develop muscle memory for interactions
- Responsive interfaces that perform well so I can work efficiently in terminal sessions
- Reliable state persistence so my work context is maintained across sessions

## Spec Scope

### Core Architecture Refactoring

- **MVVM Pattern Implementation**: Establish clear Model-View-ViewModel separation throughout the application
- **Component Decomposition**: Break down god components into focused, single-responsibility components
- **State Management Consolidation**: Standardize on Svelte 5 runes and contexts for all state management
- **Business Logic Extraction**: Move all business logic out of view components into testable service layers

### Component Restructuring

- **Project Page Decomposition**: Break 1,215-line project page into focused sub-components
- **Terminal Component Refactoring**: Separate terminal UI from terminal business logic
- **Header Toolbar Optimization**: Simplify and focus toolbar component responsibilities
- **Chat Component Integration**: Properly integrate or remove the Chat component

### State Management Standardization

- **Unified Context Pattern**: Standardize all shared state using Svelte 5 contexts
- **Reactive State Patterns**: Implement consistent $state, $derived, and $effect patterns
- **State Persistence Strategy**: Establish clear patterns for state persistence across sessions

### Code Quality Improvements

- **Dead Code Removal**: Remove all unused/unintegrated components and utilities
- **YAGNI Compliance**: Eliminate over-engineered features not currently needed
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Implement uniform error handling patterns across UI components
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Establish component testing patterns for the new architecture

## Out of Scope

### Functional Changes

- New feature development (focus is purely architectural)
- Changes to Socket.IO API or server-side architecture
- Modifications to terminal functionality or PTY management
- Database schema changes or backend service modifications

### Visual Design Changes

- UI/UX redesign or visual styling modifications
- Augmented-UI framework changes or replacements
- Color scheme or theme modifications
- Responsive breakpoint adjustments

### External Integrations

- Claude authentication flow modifications
- LocalTunnel integration changes
- Docker configuration updates
- CLI tool modifications

## Expected Deliverable

### Refactored Component Architecture

- **Project page components** broken into 5-8 focused components, each under 200 lines
- **Terminal component** separated into UI shell and business logic service
- **Standardized component interfaces** with consistent prop patterns and event handling
- **Service layer** extracted from all UI components with testable business logic

### MVVM Implementation

- **ViewModels** for all major UI sections (project management, terminal interface, session handling)
- **Model services** handling all data operations and state management
- **View components** containing only UI logic and event binding
- **Clear data flow** patterns between Model → ViewModel → View layers

### State Management System

- **Unified context system** replacing inconsistent state patterns
- **Reactive state management** using Svelte 5 runes throughout
- **State persistence layer** with consistent patterns for session and project data
- **Error state management** integrated into all UI components

### Code Quality Standards

- **Component size limits** enforced (max 300 lines per component)
- **Single Responsibility Principle** applied to all components
- **Dead code elimination** with 100% of unused code removed
- **Testing framework** established with example tests for new architecture patterns
