> Spec: Claude Chat Interface
> Created: 2025-08-31

## Overview

Implement a dedicated chat interface for Claude Code sessions that leverages the Claude Code TypeScript SDK to provide a conversational AI experience with enhanced UI controls. This feature will enable users to interact with Claude Code through a chat-like interface with command shortcuts, typing indicators, and configurable permissions managed through Claude.ai subscription authentication.

## User Stories

### Interactive Claude Code Chat Experience

As a developer using Dispatch, I want to interact with Claude Code through a dedicated chat interface, so that I can have a more intuitive conversational experience with better visual feedback and control.

Users will access a dedicated chat view for Claude Code sessions that displays messages in a traditional chat format with clear user/assistant message separation. The interface will show typing indicators while Claude processes requests, provide quick access to common Claude Code commands through a menu system, and allow configuration of tools and permissions. Authentication will be handled through Claude.ai subscription login to ensure secure access to Claude Code features.

### Command Menu Access

As a power user, I want quick access to Claude Code commands through a menu interface, so that I can efficiently execute common operations without typing full commands.

The command menu will present available Claude Code commands (such as /help, /clear, /undo, etc.) in an easily accessible dropdown or panel. Users can select commands from the menu which will automatically insert them into the chat input or execute them directly. This reduces the learning curve for new users and speeds up workflow for experienced users.

### Configurable Permissions and Tools

As an administrator or security-conscious user, I want to control which tools and permissions Claude Code has access to, so that I can maintain security and control over my development environment.

Users will have access to a settings panel where they can configure allowed tools, set permission modes, define system prompts, and manage MCP servers. These configurations will persist across sessions and apply to all Claude Code interactions through the chat interface.

## Spec Scope

1. **Chat Interface Component** - A dedicated SvelteKit component that renders a chat-style interface for Claude Code interactions with message history and typing indicators
2. **Claude Code SDK Integration** - Implementation of the TypeScript SDK with proper configuration for authentication, tools, and permissions
3. **Command Menu System** - A UI component providing quick access to available Claude Code commands with search and categorization
4. **Authentication Flow** - Integration with Claude.ai subscription authentication for secure login and session management
5. **Settings Panel** - Configuration interface for managing tools, permissions, system prompts, and other SDK options

## Out of Scope

- Real-time streaming of Claude's responses (non-streaming mode will be used)
- Voice input or audio features
- Multiple concurrent Claude Code sessions in the same chat interface
- Custom MCP server development (only configuration of existing servers)
- Mobile native app development

## Expected Deliverable

1. A fully functional chat interface accessible at `/sessions/[id]` as an available view along with terminal and replaces the existing chat view in mobile that displays Claude Code interactions in a conversational format with typing indicators
2. Working authentication through Claude.ai subscription login with proper session management and credential storage
3. A command menu that can be triggered via keyboard shortcut or UI button, displaying and executing available Claude Code commands
