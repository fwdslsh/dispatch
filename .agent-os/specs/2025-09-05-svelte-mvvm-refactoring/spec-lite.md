# Svelte MVVM Refactoring - Lite Summary

Transform Dispatch codebase from oversized god components (Projects.svelte 746 lines) into maintainable MVVM architecture using Svelte 5 runes with components under 300 lines each. Implement clean separation between View-ViewModel-Model layers with simple constructor injection and standardized foundation components to enable independent testing and consistent development patterns.

## Key Points

- Break down monolithic components (Projects.svelte 746+ lines) into focused MVVM components under 300 lines
- Implement Svelte 5 runes-based ViewModels with constructor injection for testable business logic
- Establish consistent component foundation patterns for maintainable development workflows
