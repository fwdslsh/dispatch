> Spec: Svelte MVVM Architecture Refactoring
> Created: 2025-09-05
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Transform the Dispatch codebase from oversized god components with inconsistent architecture into a maintainable, scalable MVVM system using modern Svelte 5 patterns. This refactoring addresses critical violations where components like Projects.svelte (746 lines) violate Single Responsibility Principle and implements clean separation of concerns with simplified, readable code patterns.

## User Stories

### Developer Maintainability
As a developer maintaining the Dispatch codebase, I want components under 300 lines with clear separation between view logic and business logic so that I can easily understand, modify, and test individual components without navigating through massive files or understanding the entire codebase.

The current Projects.svelte (746 lines) violates SRP by handling project listing, creation, editing, validation, session management, and socket connections, making it fragile and difficult to extend with new features.

### Code Quality and Testing
As a developer, I want properly separated ViewModels and Services with simple constructor injection so that I can write comprehensive unit tests for business logic without complex mocking or understanding UI implementation details.

The current tight coupling makes it nearly impossible to test business logic independently from UI components.

### Architecture Consistency
As a team member, I want consistent MVVM patterns and standardized foundation components so that I can build new features efficiently using established patterns without recreating UI primitives or state management approaches.

## Spec Scope

1. **Component Decomposition** - Break down god components (Projects.svelte 746 lines â†’ 6-8 focused components under 300 lines each)
2. **MVVM Pattern Implementation** - Establish clear Model-View-ViewModel separation with Svelte 5 runes throughout the application
3. **Foundation Component Library** - Create standardized, reusable UI primitives (Button, Input, Modal, LoadingSpinner, ErrorDisplay)
4. **Service Layer Architecture** - Implement simple constructor injection pattern for ViewModels with dedicated services for business logic
5. **State Management Consolidation** - Unified context system using Svelte 5 runes replacing inconsistent state patterns

## Out of Scope

- Feature flags or backwards compatibility (direct migration approach)
- Component testing infrastructure initially (focus on ViewModels/Services only)
- Virtual scrolling or complex performance optimizations (keep lists simple)
- Complex dependency injection containers (simple constructor injection only)
- New feature development (purely architectural refactoring)

## Expected Deliverable

1. All components under 300 lines with single responsibilities and clear container/presentation separation
2. Complete MVVM implementation with dedicated ViewModels for all major UI sections using Svelte 5 runes
3. Comprehensive service layer with simple constructor injection supporting all business logic operations
4. Foundation component library with standardized UI primitives used consistently across the application
