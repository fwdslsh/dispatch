# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Desktop Enhancements (Focused)
> Created: 2025-08-30

## Overview

Enhance the desktop experience for Dispatch by implementing multi-pane terminal layouts using xterm.js and custom-built rich terminal features optimized for larger screens. All functionality will be built without external dependencies, leveraging only the existing xterm.js installation.

## User Stories

### Senior Developer Workflow

As a senior developer, I want to use multiple terminal panes side-by-side, so that I can monitor logs while running builds and tests simultaneously.

The developer opens Dispatch on their desktop and splits the terminal into multiple panes using intuitive controls. They can resize panes with mouse dragging, navigate between them with simple keyboard shortcuts, and maintain different sessions in each pane for efficient multitasking.

### DevOps Engineer Monitoring

As a DevOps engineer, I want clickable links in terminal output, so that I can quickly navigate to referenced resources.

The engineer uses Dispatch to monitor servers, with clickable URLs that open in new browser tabs. Common patterns like URLs, file paths, and IP addresses are automatically detected and made interactive.

## Spec Scope

1. **Multi-Pane Terminal Layouts** - Custom implementation of split terminals with CSS Grid/Flexbox, mouse resizing via custom drag handles, and xterm.js instances per pane
2. **Simplified Rich Terminal Features** - Basic clickable link detection using regex patterns and xterm.js's built-in capabilities

## Out of Scope

- Advanced keyboard shortcuts beyond basic pane navigation
- Command history enhancements
- Desktop-specific UI components (tabs, menu bar, status bar)
- Native desktop app (Electron/Tauri)
- File manager integration
- SSH key management
- Terminal multiplexer server (tmux/screen backend)
- Video/audio streaming

## Expected Deliverable

1. Multi-pane terminal system with custom CSS-based layout, mouse resizing, and basic keyboard navigation
2. Clickable link detection using xterm.js capabilities and custom regex patterns
