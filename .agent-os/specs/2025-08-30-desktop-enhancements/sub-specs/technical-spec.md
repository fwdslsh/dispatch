# Technical Specification

## Architecture Overview

The desktop enhancement system will be built as a focused extension to the existing terminal infrastructure, emphasizing multi-pane layouts and rich terminal output processing.

## Core Components

### 1. Multi-Pane Terminal System

- **PaneManager Service**: Vanilla JS class managing pane state and layout
- **PaneLayout Component**: Svelte component using CSS Grid for layout
- **ResizeHandler**: Custom mouse event handlers for pane resizing
- **XtermInstances**: Multiple xterm.js instances, one per pane

### 2. Link Detection System

- **LinkDetector**: Custom regex patterns for URL/path detection
- **XtermLinkProvider**: Integration with xterm.js's registerLinkProvider API
- **ClickHandler**: Simple window.open() for detected links

## Technical Requirements

### Performance

- Smooth 60fps pane resizing and animations
- Efficient rendering for 10+ simultaneous terminals
- Lazy loading for history with virtual scrolling
- Sub-100ms keyboard shortcut response time

### Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Edge 100+ (primary)
- Firefox 100+ (secondary)
- Safari 15+ (best effort)

### Display Requirements

- Minimum resolution: 1280x720
- Optimal resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
- Multi-monitor support via browser APIs

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Multi-Pane Foundation

- CSS Grid-based pane layout system
- Custom resize handles with mouse drag events
- Multiple xterm.js instances management
- Basic keyboard navigation (Alt+Arrow keys)
- Layout persistence in localStorage

### Phase 2: Link Detection

- Implement regex patterns for URL detection
- Register link provider with xterm.js
- Handle clicks to open links in new tabs
- Optional: Detect file paths and IP addresses

## External Dependencies

### Required

- **None** - All features will be implemented using vanilla JavaScript/Svelte

### Already Available

- **@xterm/xterm** - Terminal emulator (already installed)
- **@xterm/addon-fit** - Terminal fitting addon (already installed)

## API Changes

### New Socket Events

- `pane:create` - Create new terminal pane with session
- `pane:close` - Close specific pane
- `pane:resize` - Update pane dimensions
- `pane:focus` - Switch focus to specific pane

### Storage APIs

- localStorage for pane layouts and preferences
- Session storage for temporary pane state

## Security Considerations

- Sanitize all detected links before making clickable
- Validate image URLs before rendering
- Rate limit keyboard shortcuts to prevent abuse
- Secure storage of command history (no passwords)

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for pane manager and link detector
- Integration tests for pane splitting and resizing
- E2E tests for click handling on links
- Performance benchmarks for multi-pane rendering
- Accessibility testing for keyboard navigation between panes
