# Dispatch

**Secure, sandboxed execution environment for Claude AI and CLI agents - run anywhere, resume everywhere.**

Dispatch provides developers with a secure, isolated environment for running Claude AI code assistance and other CLI agents safely. Whether you're prototyping with AI-generated code, running automated scripts, or collaborating with team members, Dispatch ensures your system stays protected while giving you full access to powerful development tools.

## üõ°Ô∏è Why Developers Choose Dispatch

### **Secure AI Agent Execution**

Run Claude AI and other agents in completely isolated Docker containers. No risk to your host system, no exposure of sensitive files - just safe, sandboxed execution that you can trust.

### **Resume Sessions Anywhere**

Start work on your laptop, continue on your desktop, finish on your tablet. Dispatch's event-sourced architecture lets you resume sessions across any device without requiring cloud hosting or file synchronization.

### **Unattended Operation**

Let AI agents work while you're away. Dispatch sessions run independently in the background, so you can start long-running tasks and check results later without keeping your main system tied up.

### **Local-First, Cloud-Optional**

Everything runs locally by default. Add cloud hosting only if you want it - no vendor lock-in, no mandatory subscriptions, no data leaving your control unless you choose otherwise.

### **100% Free and Open Source**

No usage limits, no premium tiers, no hidden costs. Use it however you want, modify it, contribute back to the community.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Get a secure development environment running in under 30 seconds:

```bash
# One command setup
docker run -d -p 3030:3030 \
  -e TERMINAL_KEY=your-secure-password \
  --name dispatch \
  fwdslsh/dispatch:latest

# Open http://localhost:3030 in your browser
# Enter your password and start coding!
```

### For Developers

Set up a local development environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fwdslsh/dispatch.git
cd dispatch
npm install  # Requires Node.js 22+
npm run dev  # Opens http://localhost:5173
```

## üîí Security & Isolation Features

### **Container Isolation**

- Dispatch runes in its own Docker container
- No access to host filesystem unless explicitly mounted
- Non-root user execution for additional security

### **Secure AI Integration**

- Claude AI sessions authenticate via OAuth (your credentials never stored)
- Agent code execution isolated from your main system
- Full audit trail of all commands and outputs
- Ability to review and approve commands before execution

### **Network Security**

- Optional public URL sharing (disabled by default)
- Password-protected access to all sessions
- HTTPS support for production deployments

## üîÑ Session Management & Persistence

### **Event-Sourced Architecture**

Every session interaction is recorded and can be replayed:

- Resume sessions after browser crashes or network interruptions
- Full command history preserved across restarts
- Share session logs with team members for debugging
- Time-travel debugging through session history

### **Cross-Device Sync**

- Session state stored locally in SQLite
- Resume on any device with the same Dispatch instance
- No cloud dependency required for basic functionality
- Optional cloud backup for team scenarios

### **Multiple Session Types**

- **Terminal Sessions**: Full Linux shell access
- **Claude AI Sessions**: AI-powered coding assistance
- **File Editor Sessions**: Built-in code editor
- **Custom Adapters**: Extensible for other tools and agents
