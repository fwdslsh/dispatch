## üì¶ More Installation Options

### For Developers

Want to modify Dispatch or contribute? Set up a development environment:

```bash
# Clone and set up for development
git clone https://github.com/fwdslsh/dispatch.git
cd dispatch
npm install  # Requires Node.js 22+

# Run in development mode
npm run dev  # Opens http://localhost:5173

# Run tests
npm test
```

### Docker Compose Setup

For production deployments with persistent storage:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fwdslsh/dispatch.git
cd dispatch

# Edit docker-compose.yml to set your TERMINAL_KEY
docker-compose up -d
```

## üéØ Getting Started

### First Time Setup

1. **Start Dispatch** using one of the methods above
2. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:3030`
3. **Enter your password** (the `TERMINAL_KEY` you set)
4. **Click "Create Session"** to start your first terminal
5. **Start working!** You now have a full Linux terminal in your browser

### Working with Projects

Dispatch organizes your work into projects for better organization:

- **Create a project**: Give your work a name (like "my-website" or "data-analysis")
- **Multiple sessions**: Open different types of sessions within the same project:
  - **Terminal Sessions**: Full Linux shell access via xterm.js
  - **Claude Sessions**: AI-powered coding assistance
  - **File Editor Sessions**: Built-in code editor for quick edits
- **Persistent sessions**: Your work is automatically saved - just refresh to reconnect
- **Shared workspace**: All sessions in a project share the same files and directories

### Tips for New Users

- **Files persist**: Everything you create is automatically saved
- **Multiple tabs**: Open multiple terminal sessions in different browser tabs
- **Copy/paste**: Use standard browser shortcuts (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V)
- **Share your screen**: Enable public URLs to share your terminal with others
- **Get help**: Type common commands like `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir` to navigate

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Coding with Claude

Get intelligent coding assistance right in your terminal with Claude AI integration:

```bash
# Enable Claude AI when starting
docker run -p 3030:3030 \
  -e TERMINAL_KEY=your-password \
  fwdslsh/dispatch:latest
```

### How It Works

1. **Create a Claude session** - Choose "Claude Code" when starting a new session
2. **One-click authentication** - Click the login link that appears
3. **Log in securely** - Use your Anthropic account (opens in new tab)
4. **Start coding with AI** - Claude is now available to help with your code

### What You Can Do

- **Get code suggestions**: Ask Claude to help write functions or fix bugs
- **Explain code**: Have Claude explain complex code in plain English
- **Refactor code**: Get help improving and cleaning up your code
- **Debug issues**: Claude can help identify and fix problems
- **Learn new concepts**: Ask questions about programming concepts

**Note**: You'll need a Claude account from Anthropic to use Claude sessions. Authentication is handled via OAuth flow - simply click the login link that appears when creating a Claude session.

## üõ†Ô∏è Admin Console

Monitor and manage your Dispatch instance with the built-in admin console:

### What You Can Do

- **Monitor active sessions**: See who's connected and what they're doing
- **View system status**: Check resource usage and performance
- **Manage sessions**: Start, stop, or restart terminal sessions
- **Browse logs**: Review system logs and debug issues
- **Test APIs**: Interactive testing of system endpoints

### Access the Console

Just add `/console` to your Dispatch URL and use the same password:

```
http://localhost:3030/console?key=your-terminal-key
```

Perfect for administrators, troubleshooting, and understanding how your Dispatch instance is performing.

### Keeping Your Data

To make sure your files and projects survive container restarts, mount local directories:

```bash
# Create directories first
mkdir -p ~/dispatch-config ~/dispatch-projects

# Set proper permissions
sudo chown -R 10001:10001 ~/dispatch-config ~/dispatch-projects

# Run with persistent storage
docker run -d -p 3030:3030 \
  -e TERMINAL_KEY=my-secure-password \
  -v ~/dispatch-config:/home/appuser/.config/dispatch \
  -v ~/dispatch-projects:/var/lib/dispatch/projects \
  fwdslsh/dispatch:latest
```

### Example Setups

**Basic setup (no data persistence):**

```bash
docker run -p 3030:3030 -e TERMINAL_KEY=my-password fwdslsh/dispatch:latest
```

**With public URL sharing:**

```bash
docker run -p 3030:3030 \
  -e TERMINAL_KEY=my-password \
  -e ENABLE_TUNNEL=true \
  -e LT_SUBDOMAIN=my-dev-space \
  fwdslsh/dispatch:latest
```

## üîí Security

### Important Security Information

**Dispatch gives you full terminal access that can run any system command.** Please use it responsibly:

- **Use strong passwords** - Always set a secure `TERMINAL_KEY`
- **Don't expose publicly** - Never put Dispatch directly on the internet without proper security
- **Be careful with file access** - Only mount directories you trust
- **Monitor usage** - Check the admin console regularly for unexpected activity

### Built-in Security Features

- **Password protection** - All access requires your secret key
- **Container isolation** - Each session runs in its own secure Docker container
- **No root access** - Runs as a regular user (not administrator) for safety
- **Secure connections** - All communication is encrypted
- **Safe credential storage** - API keys and tokens are stored securely

### Best Practices

1. **Generate strong passwords** - Use random characters for your `TERMINAL_KEY`
2. **Use HTTPS in production** - Put a reverse proxy in front for secure connections
3. **Keep updated** - Regularly update to the latest Docker image
4. **Monitor access** - Review the admin console for any suspicious activity
5. **Limit file access** - Only mount the directories you actually need
6. **Use private networks** - Run on isolated networks when possible

### Common Issues

**Can't log in?**

- Check that you're using the correct password (your `TERMINAL_KEY`)
- Make sure you're going to the right URL: `http://localhost:3030`
- Try clearing your browser cookies and refresh the page
- Check the container logs: `docker logs dispatch`

**Container won't start?**

- Make sure port 3030 isn't already being used: `lsof -i :3030`
- Check that Docker is running: `docker --version`
- Ensure you have enough disk space: `df -h`
- Look at the error logs: `docker logs dispatch`

**Public URL not working?**

- Confirm you set `ENABLE_TUNNEL=true`
- Check that your firewall allows outbound connections
- Try without a custom subdomain first (remove `LT_SUBDOMAIN`)
- Look at container logs for tunnel errors: `docker logs dispatch`

**Can't save files?**

- Check directory permissions if using volume mounts
- Make sure the mounted directories exist on your host
- Verify ownership: `sudo chown -R 10001:10001 ~/dispatch-projects`

**Session keeps disconnecting?**

- Check your internet connection stability
- Try using a wired connection instead of WiFi
- Look for browser console errors (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
