# üîê Authentication Methods

SSH Key Authentication with System Integration
Users can authenticate using SSH public keys through an intuitive file selection interface. The system features:

File selection instead of key pasting for better UX
SSH key generation and download during setup
Full integration with system SSH daemon
Unified authentication - same keys work for both web interface and direct SSH access
Support for all major SSH key types (rsa, ed25519, ecdsa, dss)
Unique fingerprint generation for secure identification
OAuth Integration
Full OAuth 2.0 support for both GitHub and Google providers with:

Secure authorization flows with CSRF protection
Automatic user profile retrieval and account creation
First user automatically becomes admin
üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation
Backend Architecture:

New AuthManager class for centralized authentication handling
SSHManager class for system SSH integration and authorized_keys management
Database schema expansion with tables for users, sessions, SSH keys, and OAuth configuration
JWT-based session management with secure HTTP-only cookies
Enhanced Socket.IO authentication supporting all methods
API Endpoints:

/api/auth/ssh - SSH key authentication
/api/auth/generate-ssh-key - SSH key pair generation
/api/auth/oauth - OAuth flow initiation
/api/auth/oauth/callback - OAuth callback handling
/api/auth/setup - First-time setup wizard
/api/ssh - SSH daemon management
Frontend Components:

Two-tab authentication interface (SSH Key + OAuth)
SSH public key file selection interface
SSH key generation with secure download in setup wizard
Enhanced login page maintaining existing design aesthetic
Full PWA compatibility
Docker SSH Integration:

Updated Dockerfile with openssh-server
SSH daemon configured on port 2222 with key-based authentication only
Environment variables for SSH configuration (SSH_ENABLED, SSH_PORT)
Automatic SSH key synchronization between database and system

üîí Security Features
JWT token-based sessions with configurable expiration
Secure HTTP-only cookies with SameSite protection
CSRF protection for OAuth flows using random state tokens
SSH key fingerprint verification
System-level SSH key management through authorized_keys
No password authentication via SSH (keys only)
Automatic cleanup of expired sessions
Admin privilege system with first-user escalation
üê≥ Docker & System Integration
Container Features:

OpenSSH server runs on port 2222
Key-based authentication only (no passwords)
Environment variable control for SSH features
Automatic SSH key synchronization on startup
Unified Access:
Users can now:

Generate SSH keys through the web interface
Download and save private keys locally
SSH directly to the container using the same credentials
Use identical authentication for both web and terminal access
üì± Progressive Web App Support
All authentication methods work seamlessly in PWA mode, maintaining the existing URL changing functionality for PWA instances while providing responsive design across mobile and desktop.

üß™ Testing
Added comprehensive test coverage for:

AuthManager functionality and security features
SSH key validation and fingerprint generation
System SSH integration with SSHManager
API endpoint authentication flows
JWT token generation and verification
The implementation follows all project conventions using Svelte 5 runes, maintains the existing Socket.IO architecture, and provides a modern, secure authentication system that leverages the server's native SSH capabilities for unified access control.
