## Documentation Updates Made

### ✅ Updated todos.md

- Reorganized into "Completed Items" and "Triaged Items" sections
- Marked each actionable item as "[TRIAGED → ISSUE TBD]" with priority
- Preserved all original content with enhanced organization

### ✅ Updated refactoring-plan.md

- Updated Implementation Checklist with [TRIAGED] markers
- Preserved comprehensive 7-phase plan for future reference

### ✅ Updated CODEBASE_INCONSISTENCIES_REPORT.md

- Added triage note to Recommendations section
- Marked immediate and short-term items for GitHub issue conversion
- Preserved detailed technical analysis for ongoing reference

## Deliverables Created

### ✅ GitHub Issues Template (`docs/GITHUB_ISSUES_TO_CREATE.md`)

Comprehensive template file containing:

- 11 detailed GitHub issue templates ready for creation
- Proper categorization by priority (High/Medium/Low)
- Complete descriptions, acceptance criteria, and implementation details
- Labels and assignee suggestions
- Cross-references to source documentation

### ✅ Verification of Current State

- Confirmed missing `get-public-url` socket handler (high priority)
- Confirmed type errors in SessionSocketManager.js (high priority)
- Confirmed broken test imports (high priority)
- Confirmed missing socket event constants (medium priority)
- Confirmed missing log level gating (low priority)

## Issue Creation Status

### Manual Process Required

Due to environment limitations (DNS proxy blocking GitHub API), the GitHub issues need to be created manually using the templates in `docs/GITHUB_ISSUES_TO_CREATE.md`.

### Recommended Creation Order

1. **First Sprint**: Create Priority 1 issues (#1-4)
2. **Second Sprint**: Create Priority 2 issues (#5-8)
3. **Future Sprints**: Create Priority 3 issues (#9-11) as needed

## Compliance with Requirements

✅ **Requirement 1**: Gathered complete list of actionable items from all three docs  
✅ **Requirement 2**: Categorized and prioritized items by bug/refactor/documentation/etc  
✅ **Requirement 3**: Verified relevance and created detailed issue templates  
✅ **Requirement 4**: Ensured every actionable item is tracked or marked obsolete  
✅ **Outcome**: Every item in the three docs is either tracked for GitHub issue creation or marked as completed

## Next Steps for Repository Maintainers

1. **Create Priority 1 GitHub issues** using templates from `docs/GITHUB_ISSUES_TO_CREATE.md`
2. **Verify socket reconnection** - highest priority verification task
3. **Implement get-public-url handler** - highest priority quick win
4. **Fix type errors and test imports** - blocks development productivity
5. **Plan follow-up sprints** for medium and low priority items

## Files Modified

- ✅ `docs/todos.md` - Updated with triage status
- ✅ `docs/refactoring-plan.md` - Updated with triage status
- ✅ `docs/CODEBASE_INCONSISTENCIES_REPORT.md` - Updated with triage status
- ✅ `docs/GITHUB_ISSUES_TO_CREATE.md` - Created with issue templates

## Repository Health Impact

This triage process provides:

- Clear roadmap for addressing technical debt
- Prioritized action items for development team
- Better organization of outstanding work
- Foundation for sprint planning and issue tracking
