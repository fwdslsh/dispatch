# Unified Session Implementation Tasks (Historical)

This document outlined the detailed tasks required to implement the unified session pattern from the UNIFIED_SESSION_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md.

## Status Update (September 2025)

**The unified session refactor is now complete.**

All major tasks described below have been implemented:

- Unified database schema and event-sourced session history

- RunSessionManager and adapters for PTY and Claude
- Unified Socket.IO event handling
- Unified client RunSessionClient
- API and service initialization updates


**What remains:**

- Final migration of a few client components to use RunSessionClient exclusively

- Update and modernize tests to use unified run:* events
- Documentation and code cleanup

## Benefits of New Architecture

1. **Stateless UI Recovery**: All UI state can be rebuilt from (runId, seq) cursor
2. **Multi-Client Support**: Multiple tabs can attach to same runId with synchronized events
3. **Reliable Resume**: After disconnect, clients request events since last seen sequence
4. **Extensible Event Types**: Easy to add new channels without changing core architecture
5. **Simplified Testing**: Event-driven architecture with clear input/output
6. **Better Observability**: All session activity logged in queryable event stream

## Implementation Notes

- This was a direct refactor approach suitable for POC â€“ no gradual migration needed
- Breaking changes were acceptable since this is not production
- Focus was on simplicity and maintainability over backwards compatibility
- Event-sourced design enables powerful debugging and replay capabilities
- Unified pattern reduces cognitive load and maintenance burden

## Remaining Work

- Complete migration of any remaining client components and tests
- Remove any dead code or legacy event constants
- Update documentation to reflect the new architecture

**The codebase now uses the unified session pattern throughout. Only minor cleanup and modernization tasks remain.**
