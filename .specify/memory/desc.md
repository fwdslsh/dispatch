Dispatch is an open-source, containerized development environment designed to securely run Claude AI and other AI code assistance CLI agents in isolation. By leveraging a sandboxed Docker container, Dispatch ensures that all agent activity is separated from your host system, providing robust security to prevent damage to the host system. Its event-sourced architecture preserves every session's state, enabling seamless resumption of work across devices and even after interruptions or crashes. Users can start a session on one device and continue on another, with full command history. Dispatch is designed to be used by a single user and can be hosted locally or in a remote container instance.

Key features of Dispatch include support for multiple session types—such as Terminal, Claude AI, and File Editor—each running in a given workspace. The user can have multiple workspaces, running various session types in each workspace simultaneously. The platform integrates real-time updates and persistent event storage, and offers VS Code Remote Tunnel integration for direct IDE access. Dispatch is local-first, with no vendor lock-in or usage limits, and is highly configurable through environment variables. It is ideal for AI-assisted development workflows, automation, and any scenario where secure, resumable execution is required.
