# Feature Specification: Settings Normalization and Unification

**Feature Branch**: `003-settings-normalization-should`  
**Created**: September 28, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "settings normalization should use the content of the #file:SettingsModal.svelte as the basis for the content on the #file:+page.svelte so that the settings page has the left tabs menu and incorporates all existing settings components. we should also move all settings related components to a single directory instead of having them scattered across directories, and do any other clean up possible during this feature update (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user visits the settings page to configure their preferences, workspace, authentication, and other system settings. The user expects a unified, modern interface with a left-side tab menu, and all settings options accessible in one place.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user opens the settings page, **When** the page loads, **Then** the user sees a left-side tab menu with all available settings sections.
2. **Given** the user selects a tab, **When** the tab is clicked, **Then** the corresponding settings panel is displayed.
3. **Given** the user updates a setting in any section, **When** the user saves, **Then** the change is persisted and a confirmation is shown.
4. **Given** settings components were previously scattered, **When** the update is complete, **Then** all settings-related components are located in a single directory.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a settings component fails to load? 
- How does the system handle missing or corrupt user preferences?
- What if a user tries to access a settings section that no longer exists after normalization?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST present the settings page with a left-side tab menu for navigation between settings sections.
- **FR-002**: System MUST unify all settings-related components into a single directory for maintainability.
- **FR-003**: System MUST incorporate all existing settings sections (preferences, retention, authentication, workspace, etc.) into the unified settings page.
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to view and update settings in each section, with changes persisted appropriately.
- **FR-005**: System MUST display a confirmation message when settings are saved successfully.
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle errors gracefully if a settings component fails to load or save.
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure that navigation between tabs is accessible and keyboard-navigable.
- **FR-008**: System MUST remove or update any references to old settings component locations after migration.
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain or improve the visual and usability standards of the settings UI.
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide a clear structure for adding new settings sections in the future.

### Key Entities
- **Settings Page**: The unified interface for all user and system configuration.
- **Settings Section**: Each tab/panel representing a category of settings (e.g., Preferences, Retention, Auth, Workspace).
- **Settings Component**: UI component responsible for rendering and managing a specific settings section.
