# Data Model: Settings Normalization and Unification

## Entities

### SettingsPage

- Represents the unified settings interface
- Attributes: sections (array of SettingsSection), activeSection (string), error (string|null), savedMessage (string|null)

### SettingsSection

- Represents a category of settings (e.g., Preferences, Retention, Auth, Workspace)
- Attributes: id (string), label (string), icon (component), component (Svelte component)

### SettingsComponent

- UI component responsible for rendering and managing a specific settings section
- Attributes: sectionId (string), state (object), onSave (function), onError (function)

## Relationships

- SettingsPage has many SettingsSection
- Each SettingsSection is rendered by a SettingsComponent

## Validation Rules

- Section IDs must be unique
- Only one section can be active at a time
- All settings changes must be validated before saving

## State Transitions

- On tab change: activeSection is updated
- On save: savedMessage is set, error is cleared
- On error: error is set, savedMessage is cleared
