# Research: Settings Normalization and Unification

## Unknowns from Technical Context

No major unknowns or clarifications remain. All requirements and user stories are clear from the feature spec.

## Best Practices

- Use a single directory for all settings-related components to improve maintainability and discoverability.
- Implement a left-side tab navigation for settings, following modern UI/UX conventions.
- Ensure accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA roles) for all navigation and content panels.
- Use Svelte 5 runes and MVVM pattern for state management and component structure.
- Provide clear error handling and user feedback for all settings actions.
- Maintain test-driven development: add/adjust unit and E2E tests for all new/changed settings flows.

## Decisions

- All settings components will be moved to a single directory (e.g., `src/lib/client/settings/`).
- The settings page will use a left-side tab menu, modeled after the current modal design.
- All existing settings sections (preferences, retention, authentication, workspace, etc.) will be unified under this new structure.

## Rationale

- Centralizing settings components reduces code duplication and confusion.
- A unified tabbed UI improves user experience and discoverability.
- Following project conventions (Svelte 5, MVVM, accessibility) ensures maintainability and compliance with the constitution.

## Alternatives Considered

- Keeping settings components scattered: rejected due to maintainability and discoverability issues.
- Using a top-tab or dropdown navigation: rejected in favor of a more scalable and visually clear left-side tab menu.
