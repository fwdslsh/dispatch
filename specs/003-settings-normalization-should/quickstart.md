# Quickstart: Settings Normalization and Unification

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- SvelteKit project dependencies installed (`npm install`)

## Steps

1. **Checkout the feature branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout 003-settings-normalization-should
   ```

2. **Move all settings-related components to a single directory:**
   - Consolidate all settings UI and logic under `src/lib/client/settings/`.
3. **Update the settings page:**
   - Refactor `src/routes/settings/+page.svelte` to use a left-side tab menu consistent with the legacy settings modal experience.
   - Import and register all settings sections as tabs.
4. **Ensure accessibility and usability:**
   - Add ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and clear focus states for all tabs and panels.
5. **Test the new settings UI:**
   - Run unit tests: `npm test`
   - Run E2E tests: `npm run test:e2e`
6. **Verify all settings are functional:**
   - Update, save, and reload settings in each section to confirm persistence and error handling.
7. **Commit and push changes:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(settings): unify settings UI and components"
   git push origin 003-settings-normalization-should
   ```
