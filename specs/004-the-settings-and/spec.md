# Feature Specification: Settings and Configuration Normalization

**Feature Branch**: `004-the-settings-and`
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "the settings and configuration of the application and the docker container need to be normalized and cleaned up without breaking any existing functionality. many of the configuration options are not utilized and are legacy/deprecated. it also appears that some of the settings available in the UI are not utilized by the application and/or are duplicated in multiple sections of the settings page. the application settings should be cleaned up to remove duplicates and unused items."

**Note**: Authentication settings (terminal key and OAuth configuration) are currently only configurable via environment variables and are not exposed in the UI. This feature includes implementing UI controls for these authentication settings as part of the configuration normalization effort.

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29

- Q: When environment variables and UI settings both exist for the same configuration, which source should take precedence? ‚Üí A: UI settings always override environment variables
- Q: What level of validation should the system provide for configuration settings? ‚Üí A: Both startup and runtime validation
- Q: Should the system provide user-facing documentation for migrated settings? ‚Üí A: Internal documentation only for developers
- Q: How long should the system maintain backward compatibility for legacy configuration formats? ‚Üí A: No backward compatibility - immediate cutover
- Q: What should happen to user data for deprecated settings being removed? ‚Üí A: Create backup of data directory then initialize new database
- Q: Should the system automatically backup the database or rely on manual developer action? ‚Üí A: Manual developer backup - provide documentation only
- Q: When authentication settings are modified while users are actively connected, how should the system handle existing sessions? ‚Üí A: Active connections must re-authenticate, other sessions immediately expired
- Q: How should duplicate settings with different values be consolidated? ‚Üí A: Not applicable - existing databases will be deleted, no migration needed
- Q: How should the system handle invalid OAuth configuration entries? ‚Üí A: Reject changes and keep previous configuration

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As an administrator, I need a clean and organized settings interface where all configuration options are clearly presented without duplication, all options actually affect the application's behavior, and legacy/deprecated settings are removed, so that I can efficiently manage the application without confusion or encountering non-functional settings. Additionally, I need access to authentication settings that are currently only configurable via environment variables, including terminal key and OAuth configuration.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the administrator is on the settings page, **When** they view the configuration options, **Then** no single setting should appear in multiple locations on the same page
2. **Given** the administrator modifies any configuration setting, **When** they save the changes, **Then** the application behavior should reflect the change appropriately
3. **Given** the administrator views available configuration options, **When** they review the entire settings interface, **Then** no deprecated or non-functional settings should be present
4. **Given** existing configurations are in place, **When** the cleanup is performed, **Then** all existing functionality must continue to work without requiring manual intervention (except possibly deleting existing database manually)
5. **Given** a developer has existing saved preferences, **When** the settings are normalized, **Then** the developer must be instructed to manually backup and delete the existing database to allow recreation
6. **Given** the application starts up, **When** configuration is loaded, **Then** all settings must be validated before the application becomes operational
7. **Given** a user modifies a setting in the UI, **When** they attempt to save an invalid value, **Then** the system must reject the change with a clear error message
8. **Given** the administrator needs to change authentication settings, **When** they access the settings page, **Then** they must be able to modify terminal key and OAuth configuration through the UI
9. **Given** the administrator modifies authentication settings in the UI, **When** they save the changes, **Then** the new authentication configuration must take effect after appropriate validation

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user has saved values for deprecated settings that are being removed? (Resolved: manual backup by developer, database recreation)
- How does system handle conflicting values when duplicate settings are consolidated? (Resolved: not applicable - database deletion, no migration)
- How does system handle UI settings overriding environment variables at runtime?
- How does system handle the immediate cutover for existing deployments?
- What happens when authentication settings are changed while users are actively connected? (Resolved: active connections must re-authenticate, other sessions expired)
- How does system handle invalid OAuth configuration entries? (Resolved: reject changes, keep previous configuration)

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST identify and document all configuration settings currently available in both the UI and container environment
- **FR-002**: System MUST remove all duplicate configuration options, keeping only one authoritative section for each setting
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate that all remaining settings in the UI actually affect application behavior when modified
- **FR-004**: System MUST remove all deprecated or non-functional configuration options from the user interface
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve all existing functionality without breaking changes during the normalization process
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear documentation instructing developers to manually backup existing database files if desired and delete the existing database to allow the application to recreate it
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide internal developer documentation mapping old settings to new locations for maintenance and debugging purposes
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure UI settings take precedence over environment variables when both are present for the same configuration
- **FR-009**: System MUST perform immediate cutover to new configuration structure without maintaining backward compatibility for legacy formats
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide both startup and runtime validation for all configuration settings to ensure values are valid before being applied
- **FR-011**: System MUST automatically recreate the database with normalized structure when the existing database has been manually deleted
- **FR-012**: Developer documentation MUST include step-by-step instructions for manually backing up and removing the existing database before normalization
- **FR-013**: System MUST implement UI controls for authentication settings that are currently only configurable via environment variables, including terminal key and oauth configuration
- **FR-014**: System MUST implement UI controls for OAuth settings that are currently only configurable via environment variables
- **FR-015**: System MUST validate authentication setting changes to ensure security requirements are met before applying them
- **FR-016**: System MUST require active connections to re-authenticate when authentication settings are changed, and immediately expire all other sessions
- **FR-017**: System MUST reject invalid OAuth configuration changes and retain the previous valid configuration

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Configuration Setting**: A single configurable parameter that affects application behavior, with attributes like name, value, type, category, and whether it's active or deprecated
- **Settings Category**: A logical grouping of related configuration settings (e.g., Authentication, Workspace, UI Preferences, Terminal)
- **Authentication Settings**: Security-related configuration including terminal key and OAuth parameters that must be accessible through the UI
- **Configuration Source**: The origin of a configuration value (UI setting, environment variable, default value), with UI settings having highest priority, followed by environment variables, then defaults
- **Migration Mapping**: The relationship between old/deprecated settings and their new normalized equivalents for data migration purposes
