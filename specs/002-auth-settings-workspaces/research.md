# Research: UI Components for Authentication, Workspace Management, and Maintenance

## Authentication Session Management

**Decision**: Use existing terminal key mechanism with enhanced 30-day rolling session persistence

**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing authentication infrastructure
- Rolling 30-day window provides good UX without compromising security
- Browser session tracking allows automatic renewal on activity

**Alternatives considered**:
- JWT tokens: More complex, unnecessary for single-user instances
- Session-only auth: Poor UX requiring frequent re-authentication
- Permanent sessions: Security risk

## Onboarding Workflow Architecture

**Decision**: Progressive disclosure with minimal required steps and optional advanced configuration

**Rationale**:
- Reduces cognitive load for new users
- Allows quick start for experienced users
- Advanced features remain discoverable but non-blocking

**Alternatives considered**:
- Comprehensive onboarding: Too overwhelming for simple use cases
- Minimal only: Advanced users would miss important features
- Wizard-style: Too rigid for varying user needs

## Component Architecture Patterns

**Decision**: Extend existing ProjectSessionMenu component for workspace navigation

**Rationale**:
- Consistent with existing codebase patterns
- Users already familiar with session menu location
- Leverages existing dropdown/menu infrastructure

**Alternatives considered**:
- Sidebar navigation: Would require major layout changes
- Separate workspace menu: Creates UI fragmentation
- Modal-based switching: Poor accessibility and UX

## State Management Strategy

**Decision**: Use Svelte 5 runes ($state, $derived) with ServiceContainer dependency injection

**Rationale**:
- Consistent with existing MVVM architecture
- Reactive updates for onboarding progress and workspace state
- Testable with clear separation of concerns

**Alternatives considered**:
- External state library: Adds complexity without clear benefit
- Component-only state: Difficult to share across onboarding steps
- Global variables: Poor testability and maintainability

## Retention Policy Implementation

**Decision**: Simple summary preview with configurable time periods for sessions and logs

**Rationale**:
- Users need awareness of data impact without overwhelming detail
- Sessions and logs are core data types that benefit from cleanup
- Time-based policies are intuitive and easy to configure

**Alternatives considered**:
- Detailed file-by-file preview: Too complex for most users
- Interactive selection: Adds significant complexity
- Size-based policies: Less predictable than time-based

## Testing Strategy

**Decision**: TDD with component tests (Vitest), integration tests for workflows, E2E for user journeys

**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for TDD
- Component tests ensure UI behavior correctness
- Integration tests verify API interactions
- E2E tests validate complete user experiences

**Alternatives considered**:
- Unit tests only: Insufficient for UI workflows
- E2E tests only: Slow feedback cycle and poor debugging
- Manual testing: Not sustainable and error-prone

## Database Schema Integration

**Decision**: Extend existing SQLite schema with minimal additions for user preferences and onboarding state

**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing workspace management tables
- Minimal schema changes reduce migration complexity
- Event-sourced architecture already supports user preference persistence

**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate preferences database: Unnecessary complexity
- File-based preferences: Harder to query and manage
- No persistence: Poor UX for returning users

## Performance Considerations

**Decision**: Lazy loading for settings components, eager loading for onboarding detection

**Rationale**:
- Settings accessed less frequently - lazy loading reduces bundle size
- Onboarding detection needs immediate response for first-time users
- Maintains sub-100ms performance goals

**Alternatives considered**:
- Eager load everything: Increases initial bundle size
- Lazy load everything: Poor UX for critical onboarding flow
- Server-side rendering: Adds complexity for minimal benefit

## Accessibility and Usability

**Decision**: Follow existing component patterns with keyboard navigation and ARIA labels

**Rationale**:
- Consistent with existing codebase accessibility standards
- Progressive onboarding naturally supports varying user capabilities
- Workspace navigation should be keyboard accessible

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom accessibility implementation: Inconsistent with existing patterns
- Minimal accessibility: Excludes users with disabilities
- Over-engineered accessibility: Adds complexity without proportional benefit
