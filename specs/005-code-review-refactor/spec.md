## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01

- Q: When automated refactoring encounters edge cases in syntax conversion, what is the preferred approach? ‚Üí A: Use Svelte documentation to apply best practices with best-effort conversion; flag complex cases for manual review
- Q: What mechanism should be used to keep documentation artifacts up-to-date with refactored code? ‚Üí A: Post-refactor review - dedicated documentation pass after code changes complete
- Q: When breaking down large files reveals hidden dependencies or tightly coupled logic, what is the acceptable approach? ‚Üí A: Refactor dependencies through interfaces/abstractions if achievable without undue complexity; consult specialized agents for guidance; flag complex cases for manual review and proceed to next task
- Q: For modularization to be considered successful, what is the maximum acceptable file size for a refactored module? ‚Üí A: No hard limit
- Q: What testing strategy should validate that functionality is preserved after refactoring? ‚Üí A: Regression suite - run existing tests plus manual spot-checks on critical paths

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a developer working on the Dispatch codebase, I need the application to use modern Svelte 5 patterns consistently throughout so that I can understand the codebase faster, contribute more effectively, and avoid confusion from mixed syntax patterns.

As a new contributor, I need clear documentation of architectural patterns so that I understand why certain design decisions were made and can follow established conventions.

As a maintainer, I need large files broken into manageable modules so that I can review changes more easily, reduce merge conflicts, and test components in isolation.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer opens any Svelte component, **When** they examine the props syntax, **Then** all components use Svelte 5 `$props()` syntax with no legacy `export let` declarations

2. **Given** a new contributor reads the project documentation, **When** they look for architectural patterns, **Then** they find clear documentation explaining the "runes-in-classes" MVVM pattern and its rationale

3. **Given** a developer needs to understand session API functionality, **When** they open the SessionApiClient module, **Then** they find the code organized into logical submodules (queries, mutations, validation) rather than a single 970-line file

4. **Given** a developer works on the ClaudePane component, **When** they need to modify tool panel behavior, **Then** they can locate the relevant subcomponent without navigating through 1,800 lines of mixed concerns

5. **Given** a code reviewer examines a pull request, **When** they check for consistency, **Then** all code follows the same modern patterns without legacy syntax variations

6. **Given** refactoring is complete, **When** the regression suite runs, **Then** all existing tests pass and manual verification confirms critical user workflows function correctly

### Edge Cases

- **Syntax conversion edge cases**: When encountering complex patterns (e.g., dynamic props, computed prop names), consult Svelte 5 documentation for best-practice conversion; flag ambiguous cases with inline comments for manual developer review
- **Documentation synchronization**: Dedicated documentation review pass occurs after all refactoring code changes are complete to ensure accuracy and consistency
- **Hidden dependencies**: When file modularization reveals tightly coupled logic, attempt to refactor dependencies using interfaces/abstractions if complexity is reasonable; consult refactoring specialists for guidance; flag overly complex coupling for manual review and continue with next modularization task

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Must-Do (High Priority)

- **FR-001**: System MUST validate refactored code preserves existing functionality through:
  - Execution of full existing test suite with 100% pass rate
  - Manual spot-checks of critical user workflows (terminal sessions, Claude sessions, workspace management)
  - Regression testing before merging any refactored code

- **FR-002**: System MUST eliminate all legacy Svelte 4 props syntax (`export let`) and replace with Svelte 5 `$props()` in the following files:
  - WorkspaceCreationStep.svelte
  - AuthenticationStep.svelte
  - testing/+page.svelte

- **FR-003**: System MUST provide developer documentation explaining the "runes-in-classes" MVVM pattern, including:
  - Why this pattern was chosen
  - When to use runes in classes vs functional patterns
  - Examples from the codebase
  - Guidance for new contributors
  - Documentation updated via dedicated review pass after code refactoring completion

- **FR-004**: System MUST modularize SessionApiClient.js (currently ~970 lines) by separating concerns into distinct modules:
  - Query operations module
  - Mutation operations module
  - Validation and helper utilities module
  - Success measured by logical cohesion and separation of concerns, not strict line count limits

#### Should-Do (Medium Priority)

- **FR-005**: System MUST extract subcomponents from ClaudePane.svelte (currently ~1,800 lines) including:
  - Tool panel subcomponent
  - Trace panel subcomponent
  - Message list subcomponent
  - Input area subcomponent
  - Associated viewmodels for complex logic
  - Success measured by clear responsibility boundaries and improved maintainability, not strict size targets

- **FR-006**: System MUST provide contributor documentation for the adapter pattern, explaining:
  - How to register new adapters
  - How to wire client-side components
  - File paths and conventions
  - Minimal working example

- **FR-007**: System MUST establish standardized async error-handling patterns in viewmodels with consistent return shapes:
  - Success/failure indicators
  - Error message formatting
  - Loading state management

#### Nice-to-Have (Low Priority)

- **FR-008**: System MAY extract layout logic from WindowManager.svelte (~395 lines) into helper modules for improved testability

- **FR-009**: System MAY adopt SvelteKit `+page.server.js` load functions where SSR/progressive enhancement provides clear UX improvements

- **FR-010**: System MAY introduce optional JWT authentication strategy while maintaining current Authorization header semantics

### Key Entities

- **Svelte Components**: UI elements requiring props syntax updates and potential modularization
  - WorkspaceCreationStep, AuthenticationStep, testing page
  - ClaudePane (requires extraction into subcomponents)
  - WindowManager (candidate for logic extraction)

- **Service Modules**: JavaScript modules requiring refactoring for size/complexity
  - SessionApiClient (requires domain-based splitting)
  - Potential viewmodel extractions from large components

- **Documentation Artifacts**: New or updated documentation files
  - MVVM pattern documentation
  - Adapter registration guide
  - Contributor onboarding materials

- **Architecture Patterns**: Design patterns requiring documentation
  - Runes-in-classes pattern
  - Adapter registration and client wiring
  - Async error-handling conventions

## Notes

This specification is derived from the comprehensive code review document at `specs/.pending/code-review/code-review.md`. The code review provides detailed technical analysis and specific file paths, which will be referenced during the planning and implementation phases. This specification focuses on the "what" and "why" while the code review document serves as the detailed technical reference for "how" during implementation.

The requirements are prioritized according to the code review's recommendations:

- **Must-Do**: Small, high-signal improvements with immediate impact
- **Should-Do**: Next iteration improvements for maintainability
- **Nice-to-Have**: Optional enhancements that may be deferred

All changes must preserve existing functionality and the established MVVM architecture. The goal is modernization and clarity, not architectural redesign.
