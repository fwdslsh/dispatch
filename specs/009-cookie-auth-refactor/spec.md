# Feature Specification: Cookie-Based Authentication System

**Feature Branch**: `009-cookie-auth-refactor`
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "cookie-auth-refactor create a new spec from the @specs/.pending/cookies.md document. keep in mind this app has not been released and we do not need to be concerned with backward compatibility, migration, user notification/support etc."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature clearly defined: Replace localStorage-based auth with cookie sessions + managed API keys
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Primary operator (browser), automation scripts/CLI tools, optional OAuth users
   ‚Üí Actions: Onboarding with API key generation, browser login with cookies, programmatic access with API keys
   ‚Üí Data: Session cookies (httpOnly, Secure), API keys (hashed), OAuth tokens (optional)
   ‚Üí Constraints: Single primary user, no backwards compatibility needed (pre-release)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí None - requirements are clear from source document
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flows: Onboarding, browser login, API key management, OAuth login (optional)
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements testable and concrete
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Sessions, API Keys, Users, OAuth Providers
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details in spec (tech details in separate analysis)
   ‚Üí All requirements testable
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-09

- Q: When an OAuth provider's API is unavailable during a login attempt, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Show error message, offer fallback to API key login
- Q: Should the system enforce a maximum limit on concurrent active sessions per user, or allow unlimited sessions? ‚Üí A: Unlimited concurrent sessions (default behavior)
- Q: When an API key fails validation repeatedly (e.g., incorrect key used multiple times), how should the system respond? ‚Üí A: No rate limiting - always process validation attempt and return 401

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A developer wants to run the Dispatch application with secure authentication that separates browser access (convenient, automatic) from programmatic access (explicit API keys for scripts/automation). During first-run onboarding, the system generates an API key for programmatic use and immediately logs the browser in with a secure session cookie. The developer can then manage multiple API keys for different tools, enable optional OAuth providers for convenient login, and have all sessions automatically expire and refresh appropriately.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** fresh installation, **When** user completes onboarding, **Then** system generates first API key, displays it once, and sets browser session cookie
2. **Given** valid API key, **When** user enters it in login form, **Then** system creates session cookie and redirects to main application
3. **Given** authenticated browser session, **When** user navigates to API key management, **Then** system displays list of existing keys with creation dates, labels, and last-used timestamps
4. **Given** API key management page, **When** user creates new API key with label, **Then** system displays key once with warning, stores hashed version, and adds to key list
5. **Given** existing API key, **When** user disables or deletes it, **Then** subsequent requests with that key are rejected with 401 error
6. **Given** OAuth provider enabled, **When** user completes OAuth flow, **Then** system creates same type of session cookie as API key login
7. **Given** authenticated session, **When** user makes REST API request with session cookie, **Then** request is authenticated and processed
8. **Given** valid API key, **When** script makes REST API request with Authorization header, **Then** request is authenticated and processed
9. **Given** authenticated browser session, **When** Socket.IO connection is established with cookies, **Then** connection is authenticated via session cookie
10. **Given** valid API key, **When** Socket.IO connection includes API key in auth metadata, **Then** connection is authenticated via API key
11. **Given** active session, **When** session approaches expiration (within 24h), **Then** system automatically refreshes session cookie on next request
12. **Given** session cookie or API key, **When** user logs out, **Then** session is invalidated and cookie is cleared

### Edge Cases

- What happens when session cookie expires during active Socket.IO connection? ‚Üí Connection receives session expiration event and client redirects to login
- What happens when API key is deleted while actively in use? ‚Üí Next request with that key is rejected with 401 error
- What happens when user clears browser cookies? ‚Üí User can re-login with API key to create new session
- What happens when OAuth provider is disabled after user logged in with it? ‚Üí Existing sessions remain valid until expiration, but no new OAuth logins allowed
- What happens when multiple browser tabs are open with same session? ‚Üí All tabs share same session cookie and see synchronized state
- What happens when user requests API key creation but doesn't save it? ‚Üí Key is lost forever (only shown once), user must create new key
- What happens when OAuth provider's API is unavailable during login attempt? ‚Üí System shows error message and offers fallback option to log in with API key instead

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

#### Onboarding & Initial Setup

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide first-run onboarding flow that generates the first API key
- **FR-002**: System MUST display generated API key exactly once during onboarding with clear warning to save it

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Session**: Represents authenticated browser session with unique ID, user ID, authentication provider (api_key/oauth_github/oauth_google), expiration timestamp, and last-active timestamp for idle timeout tracking
- **API Key**: Represents programmatic access credential with unique ID, user ID, hashed secret, user-provided label, creation timestamp, last-used timestamp, and disabled flag for soft deletion
- **User**: Represents single primary operator with ID (default: 'default'), optional email from OAuth, optional display name, creation timestamp, and last-login timestamp
- **OAuth Provider**: Represents optional authentication provider configuration with provider name (github/google), enabled/disabled status, and client credentials for OAuth flow
