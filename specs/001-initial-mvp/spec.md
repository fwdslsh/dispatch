# Feature Specification: Secure, resumable multi-session AI development environment

**Feature Branch**: `001-dispatch-is-an`  
**Created**: 2025-09-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Dispatch is an open-source, containerized development environment designed to securely run Claude AI and other AI code assistance CLI agents in isolation. By leveraging a sandboxed Docker container, Dispatch ensures that all agent activity is separated from your host system, providing robust security to prevent damage to the host system. Its event-sourced architecture preserves every session's state, enabling seamless resumption of work across devices and even after interruptions or crashes. Users can start a session on one device and continue on another, with full command history. Dispatch is designed to be used by a single user and can be hosted locally or in a remote container instance.

Key features of Dispatch include support for multiple session types‚Äîsuch as Terminal, Claude AI, and File Editor‚Äîeach running in a given workspace. The user can have multiple workspaces, running various session types in each workspace simultaneously. The platform integrates real-time updates and persistent event storage, and offers VS Code Remote Tunnel integration for direct IDE access. Dispatch is local-first, with no vendor lock-in or usage limits, and is highly configurable through environment variables. It is ideal for AI-assisted development workflows, automation, and any scenario where secure, resumable execution is required."

## Implementation Status

**Current State**: Dispatch is a mature, production-ready application with most core features already implemented:

### ‚úÖ **Fully Implemented Features**
- **Event-Sourced Session Management**: Complete RunSessionManager with sequence numbers and state recovery
- **Multi-Session Support**: Three session types (Terminal, Claude AI, File Editor) with adapter pattern
- **Real-Time Communication**: Socket.IO with multi-client synchronization and event replay
- **Session Persistence**: Database-backed session history with cross-device resumption
- **Frontend Architecture**: Svelte 5 with ViewModels, state management, and reactive UI
- **Authentication**: Key-based authentication system
- **VS Code Integration**: Remote Tunnel support with device authentication
- **API Layer**: Session management endpoints (`/api/sessions/`)
- **Database Schema**: Complete schema with sessions, events, workspaces tables
- **Container Security**: Docker isolation with non-root execution

### üîÑ **Gaps Identified for Enhancement**
- **Workspace Management API**: Missing dedicated workspace CRUD endpoints (`/api/workspaces/`)
- **Service Organization**: Some logic could be extracted into dedicated services
- **Multi-Auth Methods**: Only key-based auth implemented (sufficient for single-user)
- **Retention Policies**: No automated cleanup (low priority for single-user)

This specification focuses on the workspace management API gap and optional organizational improvements.

## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"

   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27

- Q: What‚Äôs the intended authentication model for resuming sessions from another device? ‚Üí A: Shared key + OAuth; device pairing; WebAuthn; default: prompt user to choose.
- Q: What is the target session history retention policy? ‚Üí A: User-configurable (time/size quotas).
- Q: Which session types must be included in the initial release? ‚Üí A: Terminal + Claude AI + File Editor.
- Q: What‚Äôs the target reconnection experience during brief network drops? ‚Üí A: Hybrid: auto‚Äëreconnect with buffered output; if uncertainty/sensitive state, reattach read‚Äëonly until user confirms.
- Q: What‚Äôs the minimum acceptable performance target for session UI responsiveness under normal load? ‚Üí A: Best effort (no strict target).

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story

As a single user, I want a secure, local-first development environment where I can create multiple workspaces and run different types of interactive sessions (Terminal, AI assistant, File Editor) in each workspace, so I can work efficiently and safely, and seamlessly resume my work on another device with full history if I disconnect.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. Given I have created a workspace, When I start Terminal, AI assistant, and File Editor sessions within that workspace, Then I can interact with each session concurrently and see real-time updates with all activity persisted to history.
2. Given I started an AI or Terminal session on Device A and then disconnect, When I open the application on Device B and attach to the same session, Then the complete command/chat history and current state are restored and I can continue seamlessly from the latest state.

### Edge Cases

- Network interruption or temporary loss of connectivity while a command is running: session state and history remain intact and replay on reconnection.
- Brief network drops: client auto‚Äëreconnects transparently with buffered output; if potential divergence or sensitive operation is detected, session reattaches read‚Äëonly until the user confirms resume.
- App or environment restart: sessions are resumable from persisted events without data loss.
- Invalid or inaccessible workspace path: the system prevents destructive actions and shows a clear, actionable error.
- Storage pressure or quota issues: the user is informed and guided to free space or adjust retention before data loss occurs.
- Multiple tabs/devices attaching to the same session: the experience remains consistent and avoids conflicting actions in a single-user model.
- Quota enforcement: when time/size quotas are reached, the system warns the user and provides options to expand quotas, archive, or purge older events with explicit confirmation.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST support a single-user model with the ability to create and manage multiple workspaces.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST allow creating and running multiple session types within a workspace, including Terminal, AI assistant, and File Editor sessions (initial release scope).
- **FR-003**: The system MUST provide strong isolation of session activity from the host system to prevent accidental damage to the host.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST persist all session activity as an ordered event history to enable lossless session resumption.
- **FR-005**: The user MUST be able to disconnect and later resume any session from another device with full history and current state restored.
- **FR-006**: The UI MUST reflect session activity in real time while also ensuring that the persisted history remains the source of truth.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST support multiple sessions running simultaneously across multiple workspaces.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST be configurable via environment variables for key behaviors (e.g., workspace locations, auth keys, integrations).
- **FR-009**: The product MUST be local-first with no usage limits or mandatory vendor dependencies; users retain control of their data.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST offer optional VS Code Remote Tunnel integration to open workspaces in VS Code Web or Desktop via secure tunnels with device authentication.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST clearly surface security boundaries and prevent operations that could compromise or damage the host environment.
- **FR-012**: The system MUST provide clear, actionable error messages for invalid workspace paths, permission issues, or unavailable integrations.
- **FR-013**: Session history MUST remain durable across restarts and temporary disconnections without requiring manual recovery.
- **FR-016**: The system MUST provide user-configurable retention quotas for session events (time-based and/or size-based), with safe defaults and clear warnings before enforcement.
- **FR-017**: The system MUST support key-based authentication for session access. Future versions may add OAuth, device pairing, and WebAuthn for multi-user deployments.
- **FR-018**: During brief network drops, the client MUST auto‚Äëreconnect and present buffered output. If uncertainty or a sensitive operation is detected, the session MUST reattach in read‚Äëonly mode until the user confirms resume.
- **FR-019**: Under normal load, the product targets best‚Äëeffort session UI responsiveness with no strict P95 target, while avoiding regressions; future releases may introduce measurable SLOs.

*Implementation Status Update:*

- **FR-010**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED** - VS Code Remote Tunnel integration is fully functional with device authentication flow and automatic tunnel naming `dispatch-{hostname}`. Access via VS Code Web at `https://vscode.dev/tunnel/{tunnel-name}/{folder}` or VS Code Desktop with Remote - Tunnels extension.

### Key Entities (include if feature involves data)

- **User**: The single individual who operates the environment; owns workspaces and sessions.
- **Workspace**: A user-defined working area that groups files and sessions; identified by a name and location.
- **Session**: A running interactive unit within a workspace (Terminal, AI assistant, File Editor); has an ID, type, status, and event history.
- **Session Event**: An append-only record of activity for a session, ordered to enable deterministic replay and resumption.
- **Session Type**: The category of a session (Terminal, AI assistant, File Editor), determining available interactions and UI.
- **Configuration**: Environment-driven settings that influence behavior (paths, keys, optional integrations) without exposing implementation details.
