# Specification Quality Checklist: sv-window-manager Migration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All validation criteria met

**Date**: 2025-10-20

**Summary**:
- All content quality checks passed
- All requirement completeness checks passed
- All feature readiness checks passed
- One [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker was resolved by adding reasonable assumption about 30% code reduction target
- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Notes

- Code reduction target (30%) documented as industry-standard assumption for library migrations
- Specification maintains technology-agnostic focus on user outcomes throughout
