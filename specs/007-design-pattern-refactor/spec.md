## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT the refactored architecture should provide and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement specific patterns (detailed class hierarchies, exact method signatures)
- üë• Written for technical stakeholders who understand software architecture but not this codebase

---

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05

- Q: How should this refactoring be deployed to minimize risk and maintain system stability? ‚Üí A: Big Bang deployment - complete all refactoring, test comprehensively, deploy in single release
- Q: When the dependency injection system detects a circular dependency during service initialization, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Design constraint prohibiting circular dependencies via constructor injection (primary), with fail-fast error at startup as failsafe
- Q: What should happen to the existing TERMINAL_KEY authentication mechanism? ‚Üí A: Use TERMINAL_KEY as the JWT signing secret - validate key then issue token
- Q: What defines the boundary of a single transaction when coordinating across SessionRepository, EventStore, WorkspaceRepository, etc.? ‚Üí A: Per-Request transaction boundary - each API/Socket request is one transaction, all repository operations atomic
- Q: When a required service fails to initialize during application startup, what should the system do? ‚Üí A: Crash immediately on initialization failure - log error and exit with non-zero code for process manager restart

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a **developer working on the Dispatch codebase**, I need the architecture to be organized with clear separation of concerns and explicit dependencies, so that I can:
- Understand which components are responsible for specific functionality
- Add new features without modifying unrelated code
- Write unit tests with mockable dependencies
- Navigate the codebase efficiently
- Onboard new contributors quickly

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new developer wants to add a session type, **When** they review the codebase structure, **Then** they can identify the single location where adapters are registered and follow a clear pattern
2. **Given** a developer needs to modify database operations, **When** they locate the data access code, **Then** they find focused repository classes instead of a monolithic database manager
3. **Given** a developer wants to test a service, **When** they write unit tests, **Then** they can inject mock dependencies without relying on global state
4. **Given** a developer needs to add a new Socket.IO event handler, **When** they review the socket handling code, **Then** they find domain-specific handler modules instead of a single large file
5. **Given** a developer needs to understand service initialization, **When** they review the startup code, **Then** they see explicit dependency injection instead of hidden service locator patterns
6. **Given** a developer wants to add authentication methods, **When** they review the auth code, **Then** they find a clear strategy pattern with documented provider interface
7. **Given** a developer needs to modify tunnel management, **When** they review tunnel code, **Then** they find shared base class logic instead of duplicated implementations
8. **Given** a developer wants to understand required configuration, **When** they review environment variable usage, **Then** they find centralized configuration service documentation

### Edge Cases

- **Service Initialization Failure**: System MUST crash immediately with logged error and non-zero exit code, allowing process manager to restart
- **Circular Dependencies**: System MUST prevent circular dependencies through constructor injection design constraints; if detected at startup, fail-fast with clear error message
- **Mock Dependency Substitution**: Test environment MUST support dependency injection of mocks through module mocking (Vitest vi.mock()) and context overrides
- **New Session Type Event Patterns**: Adapter pattern MUST accommodate different event handling patterns through adapter-specific event emission
- **Socket.IO Event Contract Changes**: Client-side code MUST be updated in coordination with server changes; deployment is Big Bang (all changes together)
- **JWT Token Validation Failures**: System MUST return 401 Unauthorized with specific error codes (expired, invalid signature, missing claims) via consistent error response format

## Notes

This specification translates the architectural analysis document's recommendations into testable requirements. The refactoring focuses on improving developer experience through:

1. **Explicit dependencies** replacing hidden global state
2. **Focused responsibilities** replacing monolithic classes
3. **Reusable abstractions** replacing duplicated code
4. **Organized modules** replacing sprawling files
5. **Centralized concerns** replacing scattered configuration

### Architectural Patterns

**Server-Side (Node.js/SvelteKit)**:

- **Prefer ES6 Classes** for services, repositories, managers, and adapters
  - Classes provide clear constructor-based dependency injection
  - Instance methods encapsulate behavior with explicit state
  - Inheritance/composition patterns are clearer with class hierarchies
  - Examples: `SessionRepository`, `EventStore`, `ConfigurationService`, `BaseTunnelManager`

- **Use Modules** for utility functions, constants, and stateless operations
  - Pure functions without internal state
  - Configuration constants and enums
  - Helper utilities that don't need instances

- **SvelteKit Patterns**:
  - Server-side logic in `src/lib/server/` (not exposed to client)
  - API routes as `+server.js` files with typed handlers
  - Hooks for authentication and request preprocessing
  - Clear separation between server and shared (`src/lib/shared/`) code

**Client-Side (Svelte 5)**:

- **Svelte 5 Runes in Classes** for ViewModels and state management
  - Use `$state()` rune for reactive instance properties in classes
  - Use `$derived.by()` for computed values in classes
  - Use `$effect()` for side effects in class methods
  - Examples: `SessionViewModel`, `WorkspaceState`, `ThemeState`

- **MVVM Architecture**:
  - **Models**: TypeScript interfaces/types for data structures (`src/lib/shared/types/`)
  - **Views**: Svelte components with minimal logic (`src/lib/client/*/components/`)
  - **ViewModels**: Classes with `$state` runes for reactive state (`src/lib/client/shared/state/`)
  - **Services**: Business logic and API integration (`src/lib/client/shared/services/`)

- **Dependency Injection**:
  - **SIMPLE APPROACH**: Use Svelte's `setContext`/`getContext` API for sharing services in components
  - **Server-side**: Use clean ES6 module exports/imports (no DI framework needed)
  - **Pattern**: `import { sessionRepository } from '$lib/server/database'` instead of global singletons
  - **Testing**: Module mocking (Vitest `vi.mock()`) and context overrides for tests

- **Socket.IO Integration**:
  - Reactive state updates from socket events via ViewModels
  - `SocketService` with `$state` for connection status
  - Event handlers update ViewModel state, triggering UI reactivity
  - Clear separation: Socket.IO client ‚Üí Service ‚Üí ViewModel ‚Üí View

**Authentication Patterns**:

- **JWT Tokens Required**: All authentication MUST use JWT tokens
  - TERMINAL_KEY serves as JWT signing secret (not replaced, but repurposed)
  - Authentication flow: validate TERMINAL_KEY ‚Üí issue JWT ‚Üí use JWT for all subsequent requests
  - Consistent token validation across API and WebSocket
  - Token refresh and expiration handling
  - Secure token storage in client (localStorage with security considerations)
  - 401 Unauthorized responses with specific error codes (expired, invalid signature, missing claims)

**Testing Strategy**:

- **Server**: Unit tests with dependency injection, mock repositories
- **Client**: Component tests with mock services, isolated ViewModel tests
- **Integration**: E2E tests with Playwright, full stack validation
- **Deployment**: Big Bang deployment after comprehensive testing of all refactored components together

**Dependency & Transaction Management**:

- **Circular Dependency Prevention**: ES6 modules naturally prevent circular imports, fail-fast at startup if violations detected
- **Dependency Pattern**: Simple module exports (`export const repository = new Repository()`) or factory functions for initialization
- **Transaction Boundaries**: Per-request atomicity - each API/Socket request is one transaction across all repositories
- **Initialization Failure Handling**: Crash immediately with logged error and non-zero exit code for process manager restart

**Simplicity Principle**:

- **No Complex DI Frameworks**: Avoid Awilix, InversifyJS, or custom DI containers - use native JavaScript/Svelte patterns
- **Pattern**: Organize service initialization in `src/lib/server/shared/services.js` with clear exports
- **Client Pattern**: Use Svelte context API (`setContext('services', services)`) in root layout for component access

Success will be measured by:

- Developer ability to navigate codebase efficiently
- Reduced time to add new session types or features
- Improved test coverage with isolated unit tests
- No regression in existing functionality
- No performance degradation
- Clear alignment with Svelte 5 reactive patterns and MVVM architecture
- Successful Big Bang deployment with comprehensive test coverage
